# Countdown App

A countdown application built using Angular that dynamically resizes text to fill the available width. The project includes a custom **FitTextDirective** (with unit tests) to adjust text size so that it fits in one line. The design is responsive with mobile CSS adjustments, and the project structure has been reorganized to separate components and directives.
