# Countdown App

A countdown application built using Angular that dynamically resizes text to fill the available width. The project includes a custom **FitTextDirective** (with unit tests) to adjust text size so that it fits in one line. The design is responsive with mobile CSS adjustments, and the project structure has been reorganized to separate components and directives.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/catuga/countdown-app-text-rezise.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd countdown
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

5. **Open the application in your browser:**
   ```bash
   Visit http://localhost:4200 in your browser.
   ```

## Improvements and next steps
  - Improved accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
  - Performance optimizations (e.g., lazy loading, caching strategies).
  - Next steps: integrating CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive end-to-end testing, and further refactoring for scalability.
